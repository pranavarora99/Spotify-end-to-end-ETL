- An implementation of an end-to-end Data Pipeline (ETL) project utilizing the Spotify API.
- Orchestrated data extraction from the Spotify API by deploying Python code on AWS Lambda, ensuring seamless and efficient data retrieval.
- Configured an event bridge trigger to automate daily extractions, with extracted data stored in an S3 bucket for raw data preservation.
- Developed an additional AWS Lambda function for data transformation, incorporating an automated trigger with SQS to ensure reliable data processing and minimize the risk of data loss.
- Established a new S3 bucket to store the transformed data, enabling efficient data management and accessibility.
- Leveraged AWS Glue and Athena to populate analytics tables based on the transformed data files, facilitating streamlined data analysis and reporting.

These achievements showcase my skills in data engineering, cloud-based architecture, API integration, automation, and data transformation. The successful implementation of the Data Pipeline project demonstrates my ability to design and deploy scalable, efficient, and reliable solutions in a production environment.
